o	Guiragos aimed to utilize ESRI’s ArcMap software to accurately apply geographic information systems principles in charting ecologic data. Specifically, Guiragos looked at USGS data for the ‘elapios birds of Hawaii and drafted a report on their nesting patterns as affected by commercial and residential activity.

o	Mapping in this class introduced me to a newfound interested in geology, geography, and ecology. It allowed me to assess my biases and improve my ability in creating succinct reports for external organizations. Lastly, it serves as a demonstration of my ability to pull from a wide array of fields to create a comprehensive final project which neatly fulfills the critical thinking and interdisciplinary objectives of IAS.
