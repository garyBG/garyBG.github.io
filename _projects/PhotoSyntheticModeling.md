o	In this grant proposal form, Guiragos et al. accurately recognize the problems plaguing the destruction of the Amazonian Rainforest and propose a research project which attempts to tackle said problems. Guiragos mainly focuses on using drone and infra-red imaging technology to create a barrier for instant fire recognition. With this imaging model, fires could be spotted much quicker and dealt with before they destroy larger swaths of the rainforest. This project aims to collect data of the effectiveness of this approach within a targeted deployment the Brazilian state of Rond√¥nia and then present it to the ECOS and Rainforest Action Climate Fund for widescale adoption across the Amazon.

o	This project prepared me for greater research opportunities by familiarizing me with the grant and structure of collaborative research. Further, it served as an early portfolio gathering process which allowed me to draw on my experience at the university, at that point, to draft a feasible research project which me and my partners could undertake. Lastly, the research proposal deals with content strictly outside my comfort zone which allowed me to develop strategies for undertaking unfamiliar fields of study.
