o	In this academic paper, Guiragos attempts to deconstruct the definitions of enlightenment presented by Emmanuel Kant’s seminal work “What is Enlightenment”. In this, Guiragos begins by evaluating the guardian-public relationship which rests at the foundation of enlightenment according to Kant.  Guiragos argues that the use of vanguard intellectualism for the education of societies en masse did not in fact promote freedom and the betterment of the public like Kant suggested. Instead, as supported by Frants Fanon, Kant’s enlightenment formed the basis of colonialism and mass exploitation of his fellow man.

o	This paper was included in my portfolio as it was the culmination of a difficult exploration of analytic philosophy. Its construction marked the first time I had to deal with texts of that nature. Kant’s writing, the basis of the deconstruction, is marred with difficult ideas and phrasing. In fact, the build-up to writing this piece involved the condensed, but still extremely dense, canon of western philosophy from the 18th century onwards. In the course, I was able to examine ethics, self, and power-dynamics through a more analytical lens thereby challenging all my initial ideas with the assistance of the West’s premier thinkers. Through the pieces explored in class, I was able to better my prose, make my ideas more succinct, and develop strategies for tackling difficult texts.
