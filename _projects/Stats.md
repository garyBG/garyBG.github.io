o	Guiragos et al. use data from the General Social Survey of 2018 to test several null hypotheses and extrapolate greater trends. They focus specifically on the overall significance of the amount of education an individual receives in terms of holistic economic prosperity. The data and findings are extrapolated and visualized using the SPSS data-analysis system.

o	This project was invaluable in learning to analyze bias in data visualization and analysis. This project also served as an introduction to SPSS which proved to be an invaluable tool throughout my undergraduate career (specifically as it pertains to my CSS work). The ability to extrapolate findings based on large social data is crucial for my post-graduate and career orientation in Data Science as it not only lends credibility to my abilities in statistics, but also allows me to present on data while maintaining accuracy and truth. Finally, it is a project which jumpstarted my interest in data as a whole and allowed me to thrive in my larger research opportunities through the strict analysis process it introduced.
