o	In this holistic community research project, Guiragos Guiragossian and Daniel Evans worked with the city government of Redmond to identify problem areas in its bike lane demarcations. All major bike lanes were thoroughly followed, photographed, and mapped, making note of areas with less-than-desirable construction. Guiragos and Daniel then reported their findings of unsafe zones to the city, connecting their findings with the cityâ€™s Comprehensive City Plan and larger budget restrictions.

o	This project was extremely significant as it involved continued close collaboration between me, my partner, and the city of Redmond in the name of greater community work. It allowed for the use of key geographic mapping techniques acquired in other courses as well as the development of knowledge surrounding transportation networks to produce findings which proved invaluable to the City of Redmond. This project is the perfect embodiment of interdisciplinary inquiry with greater civic goals. Lastly, this project allowed for the development of key presentation skills which are extremely useful in a career setting.
