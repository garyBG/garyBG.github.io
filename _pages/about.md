Full name is Guiragos, but Gary and/or GG are much easier to pronounce. Born and raised in Plovdiv, Bulgaria but of Greek and Armenian heritage. 

Currently, an undergraduate at UW Bothell pursuing a double degree in CSSE (Computer Science & Software Engineering) and MTV ( Mathematical Thinking and Data Analysis) to be completed in 2022. 

My vision is to use CS as an interdisciplinary tool that enables me to participate in a variety of academic and career fields. Thus far, my research projects have been in everything from Bioinformatics to Convolutional Neural Nets. to City Planning.
